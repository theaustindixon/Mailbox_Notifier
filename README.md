# Mailbox_Notifier
Use ESP8266 to send user an email when their Mailbox is opened.

Requires ESP8266WiFi and ESP8266SMTP libraries. Will also need a magnetic reed switch and WIFI.

May require different baud rate to get serial output messages depending on what ESP8266 board is used. I used a NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module).
